<p align="left">[Editor: The actual Affidavit begins following these comments. &nbsp;
Before using the Affidavit, you may need to do some reformatting as well as eliminating
these comments.</p>

<p align="left">Many organizations provide services individuals can apply to change their
status from &quot;tax slave&quot; or &quot;feudal subject of the government&quot; to
Sovereign Individual. Some organizations provide you with hundreds of pages of
documentation you send to dozens of government agencies. They more or less do everything
for you. Other organizations provide courses in which they teach you how to do it
yourself. They don't want you to become dependent on them. Typically, these services cost
anything from $500 to $10,000.</p>

<p>We have developed a simple approach that may achieve the same objective an
&quot;Affidavit of Truth&quot; you file with the local County Recorder. You don't send it
to any government agencies - so you minimize the risk of raising &quot;red flags&quot; and
being put on government &quot;hit lists.&quot;</p>

<p>The Affidavit of Truth is a 12-page document that basically states that the person
declaring it is a Sovereign Individual or &quot;freeborn Sovereign&quot; consistent with
the tradition of natural common law. Several U.S. Supreme Court cases are cited in support
of this declaration. </p>

<p>The Affidavit then declares that any supposed &quot;hidden&quot; or
&quot;adhesion&quot; contracts, the government might claim have compromised the status of
the Sovereign, are null and void from the outset. Specifically covered are: 

<ul>
  <li>The use of Federal Reserve Notes; </li>
  <li>The use of a bank account; </li>
  <li>The use of a Social Security number; </li>
  <li>The use of a driver's license; </li>
  <li>Using state license plates on a car; </li>
  <li>Past tax returns; </li>
  <li>Birth certificate; </li>
  <li>Marriage License; </li>
  <li>Children in public school; </li>
  <li>Declaration of U.S. Citizenship; </li>
  <li>Voter registration; </li>
  <li>Use of 2-letter state abbreviation and zip code.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Affidavit continues to describe Federal Jurisdiction as defined by the U.S.
Constitution and a number of U.S. Supreme Court cases. Then it covers the powers and
contractual obligations of government officials and the issue of statutes and regulations
contrary to the U.S. Constitution being null and void.</p>

<p>Finally, the Affidavit includes a revocation of any power of attorney the government
might claim attaches to the Social Security number and birth certificate.</p>

<p>This Affidavit has not been tested in any court, and we cannot make any claims as to
its efficacy.</p>

<h2 align="center">AFFIDAVIT OF TRUTH</h2>

<p>Be it known to all courts, governments, and other parties, that I, </p>

<p>_______________________________________________________________________, <br>
am a natural, freeborn Sovereign, without subjects. I am neither subject to any entity
anywhere, nor is any entity subject to me. I neither dominate anyone, nor am I dominated. </p>

<p>My authority for this statement is the same as it is for all free Sovereigns
everywhere: the age-old, timeless, and universal respect for the intrinsic rights,
property, freedoms, and responsibilities of the Sovereign Individual. </p>

<p>I am not a &quot;person&quot; when such term is defined in statutes of the United
States or statutes of the several states when such definition includes artificial
entities. I refuse to be treated as a federally or state created entity which is only
capable of exercising certain rights, privileges, or immunities as specifically granted by
federal or state governments. </p>

<p>I voluntarily choose to comply with the man-made laws which serve to bring harmony to
society, but no such laws, nor their enforcers, have any authority over me. I am not in
any jurisdiction, for I am not of subject status. </p>

<p>Consistent with the eternal tradition of natural common law, unless I have harmed or
violated someone or their property, I have committed no crime; and am therefore not
subject to any penalty. </p>

<p>I act in accordance with the following U.S. Supreme Court case: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;The individual may stand upon his constitutional rights as a citizen. He is
  entitled to carry on his private business in his own way. His power to contract is
  unlimited. He owes no such duty [to submit his books and papers for an examination] to the
  State, since he receives nothing therefrom, beyond the protection of his life and
  property. His rights are such as existed by the law of the land [Common Law] long
  antecedent to the organization of the State, and can only be taken from him by due process
  of law, and in accordance with the Constitution. Among his rights are a refusal to
  incriminate himself, and the immunity of himself and his property from arrest or seizure
  except under a warrant of the law. He owes nothing to the public so long as he does not
  trespass upon their rights.&quot; <b><u>Hale v. Henkel</u></b>, 201 U.S. 43 at 47 (1905).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, be it known to all, that I reserve my natural common law right not to be
compelled to perform under any contract that I did not enter into knowingly, voluntarily,
and intentionally. And furthermore, I do not accept the liability associated with the
compelled and pretended &quot;benefit&quot; of any hidden or unrevealed contract or
commercial agreement. </p>

<p>As such, the hidden or unrevealed contracts that supposedly create obligations to
perform, for persons of subject status, are inapplicable to me, and are null and void. If
I have participated in any of the supposed &quot;benefits&quot; associated with these
hidden contracts, I have done so under duress, for lack of any other practical
alternative. I may have received such &quot;benefits&quot; but I have not accepted them in
a manner that binds me to anything. </p>

<p>Any such participation does not constitute &quot;acceptance&quot; in contract law,
because of the absence of full disclosure of any valid &quot;offer,&quot; and voluntary
consent without misrepresentation or coercion, under contract law. Without a valid
voluntary offer and acceptance, knowingly entered into by both parties, there is no
&quot;meeting of the minds,&quot; and therefore no valid contract. Any supposed
&quot;contract&quot; is therefore void, <u>ab initio</u>. </p>

<p>From my age of consent to the date affixed below I have never signed a contract
knowingly, willingly, intelligently, and voluntarily whereby I have waived any of my
natural common law rights, and, as such, <b>Take Notice</b> that I revoke, cancel, and
make void <u>ab initio</u> my signature on any and all contracts, agreements, forms, or
any instrument which may be construed in any way to give any agency or department of any
federal or state government authority, venue, or jurisdiction over me. </p>

<p>This position is in accordance with the U.S. Supreme Court decision of <b><u>Brady v.
U.S.</u></b>, 379 U.S. 742 at 748 (1970): </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;Waivers of Constitutional Rights not only must be voluntary, they must be
  knowingly intelligent acts, done with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances
  and consequences.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Typical examples of such compelled and pretended &quot;benefits&quot; are: 

<ol>
  <li><b>The use of Federal Reserve Notes to discharge my debts.</b> I have used these only
    because in America, there is no other widely recognized currency.</li>
  <li><b>The use of a bank account, with my signature on the bank signature card.</b> If there
    is any hidden contract behind the bank signature card, my signature thereon gives no
    validity to it. The signature is only for verification of identity. I can be obligated to
    fulfill no hidden or unrevealed contract whatsoever, due to the absence of full disclosure
    and voluntary consent. <p>Likewise, my use of the bank account thereof is due to the
    absence of a bank not associated with the Federal Reserve system. In general, people have
    been prevented from issuing their own currencies, and such prevention is in violation of
    the United States Constitution. Were there an alternative, I would be happy to use it. To
    not use any bank at all is impossible or very difficult, as everyone knows, in today's
    marketplace. </p>
  </li>
  <li><b>The use of a Social Security number.</b> The number normally assigned to persons of
    subject status, I use exceptionally, under duress, only because of the extreme
    inconvenience of operating without one in today's marketplace, where it is requested by
    banks, employers, lenders, and many other government agencies and businesses. My reason
    for using it is <i><u>not</u></i> because I wish to participate in the Social Security
    system, as I don't wish to participate. Let it be known that I use the Social Security
    number assigned to me <i>for information only</i>. </li>
  <li><b>The use of a driver's license.</b> As a free Sovereign, there is no legal requirement
    for me to have such a license for travelling in my car. Technically, the unrevealed legal
    purpose of driver's licenses is commercial in nature. Since I don't carry passengers for
    hire, there is no law requiring me to have a license to travel for my own pleasure and
    that of my family and friends. However, because of the lack of education of police
    officers on this matter, should I be stopped for any reason and found to be without a
    license, it is likely I would be ticketed and fined or obligated to appear in court.
    Therefore, under duress, I carry a license to avoid extreme inconvenience. </li>
  <li><b>State plates on my car.</b> Similarly, even though technically, my car does not fit
    the legal definition of a &quot;motor vehicle,&quot; which is used for commercial
    purposes, nevertheless, I have registered it with the state and carry the state plates on
    it, because to have any other plates or no plates at all, causes me to run the risk of
    police officer harassment and extreme inconvenience. </li>
  <li><b>Past tax returns filed.</b> Any tax returns I may have filed in the past, were filed
    due to the dishonest atmosphere of fear and intimidation created by the Internal Revenue
    Service (IRS) and the local assessors' offices; not because there is any law requiring me
    to do so. Once I discovered that the IRS and other tax agencies have been misinforming the
    public, I have felt it is my responsible duty to society to terminate my voluntary
    participation. Because such returns were filed under Threat, Duress, and Coercion (TDC),
    and no two-way contract was ever signed with full disclosure, there is nothing in any past
    filing of returns or payments that created any valid contract. Therefore, no legal
    obligation on my part was ever created. </li>
  <li><b>Birth Certificate.</b> The fact that a birth certificate was granted to me by a local
    hospital or government agency when I entered this world, is irrelevant to my Sovereignty.
    No status, high or low, can be assigned to another person through a piece of paper,
    without the recipient's full knowledge and consent. Therefore, such a piece of paper
    provides date and place information only. It indicates nothing about jurisdiction, nothing
    about property ownership, nothing about rights, and nothing about subject status. The only
    documents that can have any legal meaning, as it concerns my status in society, are those
    which I have signed as an adult, with full knowledge and consent, free from
    misrepresentation or coercion of any kind. </li>
  <li><b>Marriage license.</b> The acquisition of a marriage license is now being revealed as
    being necessary only for slaves. The act of a Sovereign such as myself obtaining such a
    license, through social custom and ignorance of law, has no legal effect in changing my
    status. This is because any such change in status, if any may be supposed to occur, could
    happen only through a hidden and unrevealed contract or statute. Since no hidden,
    unrevealed, and undisclosed information, if it exists, can be lawfully held to be binding,
    it is null and void. </li>
  <li><b>Children in public school.</b> The attendance of my children in government-supported
    &quot;public&quot; schools or government-controlled &quot;private&quot; schools does not
    create any legal tax obligation for me, nor any other legal obligation, because I never
    signed a contract agreeing to such obligation for the supposed &quot;privilege&quot; of
    public school attendance. <p>If any of my children have attended government supported
    &quot;public&quot; or controlled &quot;private&quot; schools, such was done under duress
    and not out of free will. Be it known that I regard &quot;compulsory state education&quot;
    as a violation of the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which states in
    relevant part: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&quot;Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime
      whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or
      any place subject to their jurisdiction.&quot;</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><b>Declaration of Citizenship.</b> Any document I may have ever signed, in which I
    answered &quot;yes&quot; to the question, &quot;Are you a U.S. citizen?&quot; - cannot be
    used to compromise my status as a Sovereign, nor obligate me to perform in any manner.
    This is because without full written disclosure of the definition and consequences of such
    supposed &quot;citizenship,&quot; provided in a document bearing my signature given freely
    without misrepresentation or coercion, there can be no legally binding contract. <p>I am
    not a &quot;United States&quot; citizen subject to its jurisdiction. The United States is
    an entity created by the U.S. Constitution with jurisdiction as described on the following
    pages of this Affidavit. I am not a &quot;resident of,&quot; an &quot;inhabitant of,&quot;
    a &quot;franchise of,&quot; a &quot;subject of,&quot; a &quot;ward of,&quot; the
    &quot;property of,&quot; the &quot;chattel of,&quot; or &quot;subject to the jurisdiction
    of&quot; any corporate federal government, corporate state government, corporate county
    government, corporate city government, or corporate municipal body politic created under
    the authority of the U.S. Constitution. I am not subject to any legislation, department,
    or agency created by such authorities, nor to the jurisdiction of any employees, officers,
    or agents deriving their authority therefrom. Further, I am not a subject of the
    Administrative and Legislative Article IV Courts of the several states, or Article I
    Courts of the United States, or bound by precedents of such courts, deriving their
    jurisdiction from said authorities. <b>Take Notice</b> that I hereby revoke, cancel, and
    make void <u>ab initio</u> any such instrument or any presumed election made by any of the
    several states or the United States government or any agency or department thereof, that I
    am or ever have voluntary elected to be treated as a United States citizen subject to its
    jurisdiction or a resident of any territory, possession, instrumentality or enclave under
    the sovereignty or exclusive jurisdiction of any of the several states or of the United
    States as defined in the U.S. Constitution in Article I, Section 8, Clause 17 and Article
    IV, Section 3, Clause 2. </p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Past voter registration.</b> Similarly, since no obligation to perform in any manner
    was ever revealed in print, as part of the requirements for the supposed
    &quot;privilege&quot; to vote for government officials, any such registration on my part
    cannot be legal evidence of any obligation to perform. Likewise, I have granted NO
    jurisdiction over me, to any political office. It is my inherent right to vote on
    elections or issues that I feel affect all of society; NOT because I need anyone to rule
    over me. On the contrary - I have used the voting process only to instruct <i>my public
    servants</i> what a Citizen and Sovereign would like done. </li>
  <li><b>Use of the 2-letter state code and zip code.</b> My use of the 2-letter state code
    and zip code in my &quot;address,&quot; which is secretly codified to indicate United
    States &quot;federal zone&quot; jurisdiction, has no effect whatsoever on my Sovereign
    status. Simply by receiving or sending &quot;mail&quot; through a quasi-federal messenger
    service, the postal service, at a location indicated with a 2-letter state code and zip
    code, cannot place me under federal jurisdiction or obligation. Such a presumption would
    be ludicrous. <p>I use these codes only for the purposes of information and making it more
    efficacious for the U.S. Postal Service to deliver my mail. </p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Use of semantics.</b> There are some immature people with mental imbalances, such as
    the craving to dominate other people, who masquerade as &quot;government.&quot; Just
    because they alter definitions of words in the law books to their supposed advantage,
    doesn't mean I accept those definitions. The fact that they define the words
    &quot;person,&quot; &quot;address,&quot; &quot;mail,&quot; &quot;resident,&quot;
    &quot;motor vehicle,&quot; &quot;driving,&quot; &quot;passenger,&quot;
    &quot;employee,&quot; &quot;income,&quot; and many others, in ways different from the
    common usage, so as to be associated with a subject or slave status, means nothing in real
    life. <p>Because the courts have become entangled in the game of semantics, be it known to
    all courts and all parties, that if I have ever signed any document or spoken any words on
    record, using words defined by twists in the law books different from the common usage,
    there can be no effect whatsoever on my Sovereign status in society thereby, nor can there
    be created any obligation to perform in any manner, by the mere use of such words. Where
    the meaning in the common dictionary differs from the meaning in the law dictionary, it is
    the meaning in common dictionary that prevails, because it is more trustworthy.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><br>
Such compelled and supposed &quot;benefits&quot; include, but are not limited to, the
aforementioned typical examples. My use of such alleged &quot;benefits&quot; is under
duress only, and is with full reservation of all my common law rights. I have waived none
of my intrinsic rights and freedoms by my use thereof. Furthermore, my use of such
compelled &quot;benefits&quot; may be temporary, until better alternatives become
available, practical, and widely recognized. </p>

<p align="center"><b>FEDERAL JURISDICTION</b> </p>

<p>It is further relevant to this Affidavit that any violation of my Rights, Freedom, or
Property by the U.S. federal government, or any agent thereof, would be an illegal and
unlawful excess, clearly outside the limited boundaries of federal jurisdiction. My
understanding is that the jurisdiction of the U.S. federal government is defined by
Article I, Section 8, Clause 17 of the U.S. Constitution, quoted as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;The Congress shall have the power . . . To exercise <u>exclusive legislation</u>
  in <u>all cases whatsoever</u>, <u>over such district (NOT EXCEEDING TEN MILES SQUARE)</u>
  as may, by cession of particular states and the acceptance of Congress, become <u>the seat
  of the Government of the United States</u>, [District of Columbia] and to exercise like
  authority over all places purchased by the consent of the legislature of the state in
  which the same shall be, for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, dock yards and
  other needful Buildings; And - To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for
  carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers...&quot; [emphasis added]</p>
</blockquote>

<p><i>and</i> Article IV, Section 3, Clause 2: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;The Congress shall have the Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and
  Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States; and
  nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to Prejudice any Claims of the
  United States, or of any particular State.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The definition of the &quot;United States&quot; being used here, then, is limited to
its <b>territories</b>: <br>
</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="10">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">1) The District of Columbia <br>

<p>It does <b>not</b> include the several states <b>themselves</b>, as is confirmed by the
following cites: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;We have in our political system a Government of the United States and a
  government of each of the several States. Each one of these governments is distinct from
  the others, and each has citizens of its own who owe it allegiance, and whose rights,
  within its jurisdiction, it must protect. The same person may be at the same time a
  citizen of the United States and a Citizen of a State, but his rights of citizenship under
  one of these governments will be different from those he has under the other.&quot;
  Slaughter House Cases <b><u>United States vs. Cruikshank</u></b>, 92 U.S. 542 (1875). </p>

<p>This is further confirmed by the following quote from the Internal Revenue Service: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>In <b>legal</b> terminology, the word <b>&quot;includes&quot;</b> means <b>&quot;is
limited to.&quot;</b> </p>

<p>When referring to this &quot;District&quot; United States, the Internal Revenue Code
uses the term <b>&quot;<u>WITHIN</u>&quot;</b> the United States. When referring to the
several States, the Internal Revenue Code uses the term <b>&quot;<u>WITHOUT</u>&quot;</b>
the United States. </p>

<p>Dozens, perhaps hundreds, of court cases prove that federal jurisdiction is limited to
the few federal territory areas above indicated. For example, in two Supreme Court cases,
it was decided: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;The laws of Congress in respect to those matters do not extend into the
  territorial limits of the states, but have force only in the District of Columbia, and
  other places that are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the national government,&quot; <b><u>Caha
  v. United States</u></b>, 152 U.S., at 215. </p>
  <p>&quot;We think a proper examination of this subject will show that the United States
  never held any municipal sovereignty, jurisdiction, or right of soil in and to the
  territory, of which Alabama or any of the new States were formed...&quot; </p>
  <p>&quot;[B]ecause, the United States have no constitutional capacity to exercise
  municipal jurisdiction, sovereignty, or eminent domain, within the limits of a State or
  elsewhere, except in the cases in which it is expressly granted...&quot; </p>
  <p>&quot;Alabama is therefore entitled to the sovereignty and jurisdiction over all the
  territory within her limits, subject to the common law,&quot; <b><u>Pollard v. Hagan</u></b>,
  44 U.S. 221, 223, 228, 229.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Likewise, Title 18 of the United States Code at §7 specifies that the
&quot;territorial jurisdiction&quot; of the United States extends only <b><u>outside</u></b>
the boundaries of lands belonging to any of the several States. </p>

<p><b>Therefore</b>, in addition to the fact that no unrevealed federal contract can
obligate me to perform in any manner without my fully informed and uncoerced consent,
likewise, no federal statutes or regulations apply to me or have any jurisdiction over me.
I hereby affirm that I do not reside or work in any federal territory of the
&quot;District&quot; United States, and that therefore no U.S. federal government statutes
or regulations have any authority over me. </p>

<p align="center"><b>POWERS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS OF <br>
UNITED STATES AND STATE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS</b> </p>

<p>All United States and State government officials are hereby put on notice that I expect
them to have recorded valid Oaths of Office in accordance with the U.S. Constitution,
Article VI: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the members of the several
  State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial officers, both of the United States and
  of the several States, shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support this
  Constitution...&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand that by their Oaths of Office all U.S. and State government officials are
contractually bound by the U.S. Constitution as formulated by its framers, and not as
&quot;interpreted,&quot; subverted, or corrupted by the U.S. Supreme Court or other
courts. </p>

<p>According to the Ninth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to
  deny or disparage others retained by the people.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited
  by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, my understanding from these Amendments is that the powers of all U.S. and State
government officials are limited to those specifically granted by the U.S. Constitution. </p>

<p>I further understand that any laws, statutes, ordinances, regulations, rules, and
procedures contrary to the U.S. Constitution, as written by its framers, are null and
void, as expressed in the Sixteenth American Jurisprudence Second Edition, Section 177: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;The general misconception is that any statute passed by legislators bearing the
  appearance of law constitutes the law of the land. <u>The U.S. Constitution is the supreme
  law of the land</u>, and any statute, to be valid, must be in agreement. It is impossible
  for both the Constitution and a law violating it to be valid; one must prevail. This is
  succinctly stated as follows: </p>
  <p>'The general rule is that an unconstitutional statute, though having the form and name
  of law, is in reality no law, but is wholly void, and ineffective for any purpose; since
  unconstitutionality dates from the time of its enactment, and not merely from the date of
  the decision so branding it. <u>An unconstitutional law, in legal contemplation, is as
  inoperative as if it had never been passed</u>. Such a statute leaves the question that it
  purports to settle just as it would be had the statute not been enacted.'</p>
  <p>'Since an unconstitutional law is void, the general principles follow that <u>it
  imposes no duties, confers no right, creates no office, bestows no power or authority on
  anyone, affords no protection, and justifies no acts performed under it</u>...'</p>
  <p>'A void act cannot be legally consistent with a valid one. An unconstitutional law
  cannot operate to supersede any existing valid law. Indeed, insofar as a statute runs
  counter to the fundamental law of the land, it is superseded thereby.'</p>
  <p>'<u>No one is bound to obey an unconstitutional law</u> and no courts are bound to
  enforce it.'&quot; [emphasis added] </p>
</blockquote>

<p>and as expressed once again in the U.S. Constitution, Article VI: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;This Constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be made in
  pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of
  the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every State
  shall be bound thereby, anything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary
  notwithstanding.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All U.S. and State government officials are therefore hereby put on notice that any
violations of their contractual obligations to act in accordance with their U.S.
Constitution, may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law, as well as the
application of all available legal remedies to recover damages suffered by any parties
damaged by any actions of U.S. and State government officials in violation of the U.S.
Constitution. </p>

<p align="center"><b>REVOCATION OF POWER OF ATTORNEY</b> </p>

<p>Furthermore, I hereby revoke, rescind, and make void <u>ab initio</u>, all powers of
attorney, in fact or otherwise, implied in law or otherwise, signed either by me or anyone
else, as it pertains to the Social Security number assigned to me, _______________________
as it pertains to my birth certificate, marriage or business license, or any other
licenses or certificates issued by any and all government or quasi-governmental entities,
due to the use of various elements of fraud by said agencies to attempt to deprive me of
my Sovereignty and/or property. </p>

<p>I hereby waive, cancel, repudiate, and refuse to knowingly accept any alleged
&quot;benefit&quot; or gratuity associated with any of the aforementioned licenses,
numbers, or certificates. I do hereby revoke and rescind all powers of attorney, in fact
or otherwise, signed by me or otherwise, implied in law or otherwise, with or without my
consent or knowledge, as it pertains to any and all property, real or personal, corporeal
or incorporeal, obtained in the past, present, or future. I am the sole and absolute legal
owner and possess allodial title to any and all such property. </p>

<p><b>Take Notice</b> that I also revoke, cancel, and make void <u>ab initio</u> all
powers of attorney, in fact, in presumption, or otherwise, signed either by me or anyone
else, claiming to act on my behalf, with or without my consent, as such power of attorney
pertains to me or any property owned by me, by, but not limited to, any and all
quasi/colorable, public, governmental entities or corporations on the grounds of
constructive fraud, concealment, and nondisclosure of pertinent facts. </p>
