Both systems concurrently exist today. 
However, the corporate system has been gaining predominance in the last 70 years.  
Many Sovereigns (We the people) have contracted with the corporate system unknowingly, unintentionally, and 
or without full disclosure. 
<br>
Which one do You want for Yourself, Your family, and Your posterity?  
Once you learn the difference, You may have to make a decision for Yourself, Your family, and Your posterity. 
That decision will require changes in how you conduct yourself. 
You will have to undo what has been done to make your Sovereign status known.
This is not taught in the corporate government's public school system, because you are not to know.  
<br>
The "One World government" system wants<br>and needs to have power and control over the population 
(masses)<br>they call "Human Resources."</font></th>

to the time of the Articles of Confederation there was a space of time of sixteen 
months and eleven days.  During this period of time, the several nations, states, 
countries were sovereign unto themselves as relates to foreign earthly powers.

There was an <strong>outstanding debt</strong> of 17 million silver Lira from french banks over 
21 separate occasions all due on December 1, 1789.
<br><br>
Therefore, a <strong>Constitution</strong> had to be drafted as a bankruptcy Charter.

In 1832, while discussing the Bank Renewal Bill to a delegation of bankers,

one consolidated government, a vast government apparatus founded not on liberty,

find loopholes, revise government and its laws to suit their needs and agenda, and  
build an empire within government itself. Through deceit and lies and through the absence of truth, 
gain power and control over the people, extracting the people's well earned money from the people's 
labor to finance and increase the empire to such an extent that 
it would seem difficult for people to rise up against it.</font>

exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves generous gifts 
from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes
for the candidates promising the most benefits from the public treasury
with the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal
policy, always followed by a dictatorship. 
<br>The average age of the world's 
greatest civilizations from the beginning of history, has been about 200 years. 
<br>During those 200 years, these nations always progressed through the following sequence: 
from bondage to spiritual faith; from spiritual faith to great courage; from courage to 
liberty; from liberty to abundance; from abundance to selfishness; from 
selfishness to complacency; from complacency to apathy; from apathy to 
dependency; from dependency back again to bondage.&quot;</font>

<br><br><font face="Arial" size="-1" color="#a0522d">
In so doing, the Constitutional due process quorum necessary for Congress 
to vote was (temporarily) lost and Congress was adjourned sine die, or "without day."  
To some, this meant that there was no lawful quorum to set a specific day 
and time to reconvene.  Some say that according to Robert's Rules of Order, 
Congress automatically dissolved because there are no provisions 
within the Constitution allowing the passage of any Congressional vote 
without a quorum of the States. Keep in mind that Robert's Rules of Order 
was created and published by Henry Martyn Robert who was born in South 
Carolina in 1837.  He sold a half million copies of his rules by 1914.  
Those rules were not made a part of the Constitution or any Amendment to 
the Constitution.  According to The Constitution, Congress was only 
required to meet at least once in every year on a specific date unless 
changed by law and a smaller number may adjourn from day to day. 
Therefore, because there were no other provisions, dissolution does not take 
place unless &quot;the people&quot;, the creators thereof, or the posterity 
thereof, the sovereigns of the states, say so.</font>
<br><br><font face="Arial" size="-1" color="#008080">Because the kings men did not attend a meeting required by Him

&quot;Saturday, April 21, 1787. . .&quot;
	<br>"That the board of treasury be authorized to contract for three hundred 
	tons of copper coin of the federal standard, agreeable to the proposition 
	of Mr. James Jarvis, . . . That it be coined at the expense of the contractor, 
	etc.&quot;  &quot;On Friday, July 6, 1787, there was "Resolved, that the board of 
	treasury direct the contractor for the copper coinage to stamp on one side 
	of each piece the following device, viz: thirteen circles linked together, 
	a small circle in the middle, with the words 'United States,' around it; 
	and in the center, the words 'We are one'; on the other side of the same 
	piece the following device, viz: a dial with the hours expressed on the 
	face of it; a meridian sun above on one side of which is the word 'Fugio,' 
	(The meaning is, 'time flies') and on the other the year in figures '1787', 
	below the dial, the words 'Mind Your Business.' The legends have been 
	credited to Benjamin Franklin by many, and the coin, as a consequence, 
	has been referred to as the Franklin Cent.&quot;
<br>&quot;These cents were coined in New Haven, Conn., and possibly elsewhere. Most of 
the copper used in this coinage came from military stores. It is believed to 
have been the copper bands which held together the powder kegs sent to us by 
the French.&quot;</FONT>

Federal Reserve is not listed under the Federal Government. They are in the white pages, 
along with Federal Express, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), and any other business. 
Find out for yourself if all this is true. And then, go to your local law library and look 
up the case of Lewis vs. US, case #80-5905, 9th Circuit, June 24, 1982. It reads in part: 
&quot;Examining the organization and function of the Federal Reserve Banks and applying the 
relevant factors, we conclude that the federal reserve are NOT federal instrumentality's . .

are listed neither as 'wholly-owned' government corporations [under 31 USC Section 846] nor 
as 'mixed ownership' corporations [under 31 USC Section 856] . . . 28 USC Sections 1346(b), 2671.&quot;

Spaniards), is short for the " Joachimsthaler" of Joachimsthal, a mining town in the Joachims Valley 
in Bohemia, where the coins were first struck in the sixteenth century.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;Thomas Jefferson recommended on September 2, 1776, to the Continental Congress, that the United 
States adopt the silver "Spanish Milled Dollar" called "Pillar Pieces of Eight", as our monetary unit 
of value, since daily trade was transacted in that coin.&quot;</FONT>

which was the amount contained in a One-Dollar silver coin.
<br><br>
The <strong>gold eagle</strong> was equivalent to Ten silver dollars and had 247.50 grains of pure gold.
<br><br>
Therefore, 371.25 grains of pure silver was equivalent to 24.75 grains of pure gold; 
<br>a <strong>15:1</strong> ratio.
<br><br>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"><P ALIGN="CENTER">Coinage started in <strong>1783</strong>. 
The first gold coins were made July 31, 1795 and consisted of 744 half eagles.
The <strong>first paper currency</strong> was issued in <strong>1862</strong>. 
Coinage of Silver coins for circulation ended 
with the 1964 coins. 
<br><br>
<strong>Silver Certificates</strong> were contracts initially redeemable in face value 
silver coin or silver bullion.
Silver Certificates were released into circulation in 1878, 
redemption in silver dollars ceased in 1934, last printed in 1957, 
and redemption in all forms ceased on June 24, 1968.
<br><br>
<strong>Gold Certificates</strong> were contracts initially redeemable in face value 
Gold coin or gold bullion.
Gold Certificates were released into circulation in 1882 and ended in 1928.
<br><br>
Under the <strong>&quot;free coinage&quot;</strong> provision, no charge was to be made for converting gold 
or silver bullion into coins &quot;weight for weight.&quot; At the depositor's 
option, however, he could demand an immediate exchange of coins for his bullion, 
for which privilege a deduction of one-half of one percent was to be imposed.
<br><br>
Although a government <strong>mint</strong> was approved February 21, 1782, 
no immediate action was taken.  
The first mint building was erected in 1792 on Seventh Street near Arch in Philadelphia.  The first coin struck was the half disme (half-dime).  
Fifteen hundred were produced during the month of July 1792 before the 
mint was completed. File marks on early coins was a mint process of weight adjustment.

The Mint was initially a part of the Department of State, became an independent agency in 1799, 
and became part of the Department of the Treasury in 1873 when the Mint's administrative headquarters 
moved from Philadelphia to Washington, D.C.

The amount of FRN's printed is based upon the corporate government's borrowing or appetite for debt. 
For example: If the corporate government prints $100 billion in interest-bearing U.S. bonds
and takes them to the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve places
the $100 billion in a checking account and the government writes
checks or prints debt currency against the balance.
In other words, this private banking system creates so-called money out of thin air and the bankers get
interest on it forever.  
In addition, new debt and debt currency has to be created just to cover the compounding interest.  
An ideal &quot;Ponzi scheme.&quot; 
<br><br>
Keep in mind that bonds are IOU's and are to be paid back by the people through their future labor 
or the labor of their posterity.  That is why wars are created and perpetuated, 
government bureaucracy and empire building increases, and superfluous spending continues.  
They create an ongoing and ever increasing debt to enslave the people and their posterity.
Debt must be continually created to feed the debt-credit economy system.
<br><br>
The so-called expanding economy always needs new debt notes (FRN's) and therefore more debt must be created.  
Budgets can never be balanced in this type of system.  
If the budget is balanced, the economy will collapse because no new FRN's can be printed and no new debt credit created.
<br><br>
The FRB pays 2½ ¢ per FRN note printed whether $1 or $1000.
The US in-turn pays FRB <U>interest</U> indefinitely for each outstanding note or
representation of a note. With electronic banking FRN's are created out of
nothing and nothing being printed. <I>What a deal!</I></FONT>

A piece of paper does not give people the right to walk the earth as one of God's creatures.  
People have that right without the Constitution, without the Amendments some people call the 
"Bill of Rights," and without a Birth Certificate.   
No Political or Royal figure can give one the right to be free or take that right away. 
The idea that one is "given" what one already has is an illusion created for the purposes of control, 
power, and manipulation.  Such an idea exists only when people allow it to exist or are ignorant of 
their rights.  
<br><br>
As a result of a king's uncontrolled spending spree, France had severe inflation which resulted in a monetary crisis.  
A group of people stormed the Bastille in Paris on July 15th 1789, and the French Revolution was born.   
The 'Rights of Man' was declared on August 26, 1789.  By midsummer of 1792, the king was dethroned and the royal family was imprisoned.  
Since the people no longer had any use for a king and queen, Louis XVI was beheaded on January 21, 1793 
and Marie Antoinette was beheaded later that year.  Therefore, it is the people who are really in control.  
It is intended for government to be the servants and the people to be the masters.  It is better for the 
government to fear the people than the people fear their government.

<br><br>Since the Birth Certificate neither lists the father as the husband

<font face="Arial" size="-1">More and more prisons today are privately owned and run as a profit making commercial enterprise creating products and services for sale.  
It is believed that many judges hold stock or an interest in these privatized prisons.  
These commercially run prisons do not have the best interest of the Inmates or Staff in mind but the bottom line--PROFIT.
They need a continuous supply of low-cost labor (slaves) to produce products in order to increase profits.
Even when the crime rate is down, these privateers lobby the appropriate governmental and judicial 
authorities to increase the incarceration rate in order to add to their already substantial profit taking.

<li>Becon-Wackenhut Inc. of Florida</li>
<li>U.S. Corrections Corporation, a private company headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky--since 1986</li>
<li>Rehabilitative Industries & Diversified Enterprises Inc. (PRIDE), a firm based in Clearwater, Florida, 
now manages all 53 Florida prison work programs as a for profit operation. PRIDE has made a $4 million profit 
in one year. Many states considering privatization of prison industries are studying the PRIDE operation.

<li>Corrections Development Corporation</li>
<li>Buckingham Security Ltd.</li>

The book "Golden Fleece in Nevada" written by Judge Clel Georgetta states "In 1780, 
the Continental Congress adopted a resolution requesting the thirteen original states to 
surrender to the central government (the Confederation) all the lands they claimed in the 
territory west of their original boundaries [west of the Appalachian Mountains] 
to the Mississippi, so such lands could be sold 
to private interests for money to pay off the debt incurred by the Revolutionary War, and 
then the area would be divided into new states to be admitted into the Confederation on the 
same basis as the original states." 
Judge Georgetta continues "The thirteen independent sovereign states were first joined together 
in a Federal Union known as 'The Confederation' and in 1781 ratified 'The Articles of Confederation 
and Perpetual Union.' Those Articles contain the following words:
Article II. Each state retains its sovereignty, freedom and independence, and every power, 
jurisdiction and right, which is not by this confederation expressly delegated to the United 
States in Congress assembled. Article IX. ...provides also that no state shall be deprived of 
territory for the benefit of the United States. 
There can be no doubt that the purpose of guaranteeing each state its complete sovereignty was 
to waylay all fear of joining the organization. It was those words of guaranty in the Articles 
that the various states joined the 'Confederation' in order to form a Central Government to 
perform certain functions for all the states as a group. It was to be a central government with 
very limited power."</font>

The thing created (the corporation) becomes more powerful than the creator

In 1867, President Andrew Johnson signed legislation creating the first 
<strong>Department of Education</strong>. 
Its main purpose was to collect information and statistics about the nation's schools. 
However, many people feared the Department would exercise too much control over local schools 
and called for its abolition. Thus, the new Department was demoted to an 
<strong>Office of Education</strong> in 1868.
In 1979, Congress passed Public Law 96-88 creating the

In the 1860's, a budget of $15,000 and four employees handled education fact-finding.

&quot;Make yourselves sheep and the wolves will eat you&quot;
-- Benjamin Franklin
<br><br> 
&quot;You will not fight for the right when you can
easily win without bloodshed, if you will not
fight when your victory will be sure and not so
costly, you may come to the moment when
you will have to fight with all the odds against
you and only a precarious chance for survival.
There may be a worse case. You may have to
fight when there is no chance of victory,
because it is better to perish than to live as
slaves.&quot; -- Winston Churchill
<br><br> 
&quot;Education is the best security for maintaining liberties, 
and, "a nation of well-informed men who have been taught to 
know and prize the rights which God has given them cannot be 
enslaved. It is in the region of ignorance that tyranny 
reigns.&quot;-- Benjamin Franklin, Autobiography
<br><br>
&quot;It will be of little avail to the people that the laws are made by men of their own choice, 
if the laws be so voluminous that they cannot be read, or so incoherent that they cannot be 
understood; if they be repealed or revised before they are promulgated, or undergo such incessant 
changes that no man who knows what the law is today can guess what it will be tomorrow.&quot;
-- James Madison, Federalist no. 62, February 27, 1788
<br><br>
&quot;If ye love wealth better than liberty, the tranquility of servitude 
better than the animating contest of freedom, go home from us in 
peace. We ask not your counsels or arms. Crouch down and lick the 
hands which feed you. May your chains set lightly upon you, and may 
posterity forget ye were our countrymen.&quot;-- Samuel Adams
<br><br>
&quot;The problem isn't what we don't know, the problem is what we believe 
to be so and isn't so.&quot;-- Will Rogers
<br><br>
&quot;..it does not require a majority to prevail, but rather an irate, tireless minority 
keen to set brush fires in people's minds..&quot; -- Samuel Adams
<br><br>
&quot;They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety 
deserve neither liberty nor safety.&quot; -- Benjamin Franklin 
<br><br>
&quot;As such, the United States now no longer exists as "united states"; rather, 
it is now simply a single entity known as "America" whose state-boundaries are now secondary, 
and which exists as a shell of its former self. It is no longer a land of peace and prosperity, 
except what little can be maintained in an atmosphere of violence and hostile competition as 
its inhabitants fight for freedom against one another, each struggling via the law of the jungle 
to "tax or be taxed, regulate or be regulated." This is only possible in an oppressive, captive 
environment, which the original system was created to preclude; the only solution, it seems, 
is to restore this former system, ending federal supremacy and once again restoring supreme 
sovereignty to the states as a check on such federal excess.&quot; -- Defining 'America' 
July 5, 2004 by Brian McCandliss who is a business and economics graduate of Liberty University in 
Lynchburg, Virginia, a law student, and a businessman in Detroit, Michigan.
<br><br>
&quot;Once a government is committed to the principle of silencing the voice  
of opposition, it has only one way to go, and that is down the path of 
increasingly repressive measures, until it becomes a source of terror to 
all its citizens and creates a country where everyone lives in fear.&quot;
 --Harry S Truman
<br><br>
Only two people signed the Declaration of Independence on July 4th, John Hancock and 
Charles Thomson.  Most of the rest signed on August 2, but the last signature wasn't added 
until 5 years later. 
<br><br>
&quot;Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the 
Consent of the Governed, that whenever any Form of Government becomes 
destructive of these Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to 
abolish it, and to institute new Government...&quot;
<br> Sound familiar?  It should.<br>  
It is from the second paragraph of the American Declaration of Independence.
<br><br>
&quot;Every act of resistance  makes tyranny weaker.
 Many, many acts of resistance, even small ones, can topple it.  I don’t
wish suffering on myself or anyone else, but I am proud of people who have
stood up for truth and justice when it was dangerous to do so.  And I’ll
be proud to BE one of those people, no matter what happens to me.&quot;
 --Tessa David Rose (Wife of Larken Rose)
<br><br>
&quot;Most people prefer to believe that their leaders are just and fair, even in the face of 
evidence to the contrary, because once a Citizen acknowledges that the government under 
which he lives is lying and corrupt, the Citizen has to choose what he or she will do about it. 
To take action in the face of corrupt government entails risks of harm to life and loved ones. 
To choose to do nothing is to surrender one’s self-image of standing for principles. Most people 
do not have the courage to face that choice. Hence, most propaganda is not designed to fool the 
critical thinker but only to give moral cowards an excuse not to think at all.&quot; 
 --Michael Rivero
<br><br>
&quot;The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.&quot;
 --Edmund Burke 
<br><br>
 &quot;No man survives when freedom fails; the best men rot in filthy jails; and those who cry 
  &quot;Appease! Appease!&quot; are hanged by those they tried to please&quot; --Hiram Mann
<br><br>
&quot;Mourn not the dead that in the cool earth lie, but rather mourn the apathetic, throng the coward 
and the meek who see the world's great anguish and its wrong, and dare not speak.&quot; -- Ralph Chaplin
<br><br>
&quot;What good fortune for those in power that people do not think.&quot; --Adolf Hitler
 <br><br>

&quot;I believe that America is the greatest country in history and for good 
reasons, but America has been changing and not for the better. Our free 
society has been falling prey to a more repressive system with methods 
for the increased control of people. The return of groups and individuals 
to the controlling ideology of Imperialism and Marxism using the structures 
of Corporation, Socialism and Democracy. The result is that this nation's

&quot;There are many people involved in the fight to 
return our country to a sovereign nation and there are many people 
who are just plain sick and tired of the "governmental" controls placed 
on our every day lives. The "government" controls our lives via taxation, 
levies, traffic tickets, code enforcement, licensing, permits, 
registrations, inspections, the mails, banking, child protective services, 
airport &quot;in&quot;-security, etc.... They listen to our telephone conversations, 
read our e-mails, rifle through our belongings during roadside searches 
and now they can come into our homes without a search warrant - even when 
we're not home. Troops are already being trained to stop us on the highways 
and demand to see our "papers please." Does any of this sound remotely 
familiar? Think it can't happen here? When is enough going to be enough?

&quot;Why of course the people don't want war. Why should some poor slob on
a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best he can get out of
it is to come back to his farm in one piece? Naturally the common people
don't want war neither in Russia, nor in England, nor for that matter in
Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the
country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to
drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist
dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no
voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders.
That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked,
and denounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism and exposing the
country to danger. It works the same in any country.&quot;--Hermann Goering</font>

 &quot;When force is the standard, the murderer wins over the pickpocket, 
 and then that society vanishes, in a spread of ruins and slaughter. 
 Do you wish to know whether that day is coming? Watch Money. Money is 
 a barometer of a society's virtue. When you see that trading is done, 
 not by consent, but by compulsion - when you see that in order to produce, 
 you need permission from men who produce nothing - when you see that money 
 is flowing to those who deal, not in goods, but in favors - when you see 
 men get richer by graft and pull than by work, and your laws don't protect 
 you against them, but protect them against you - when you see corruption 
 being rewarded and honesty becoming a self-sacrifice - you may know that 
 our society is doomed. Money is so noble a medium that it does not compete 
 with guns and it does not make terms with brutality. It will not permit a 
 country to survive as half-! property, half-loot. Whenever destroyers 
 appear among men, they start by destroying money, for money is men's 
 protection, and the base of a moral existence.&quot; --Ayn Rand,

  <font face="Arial" size="-1" color="Aqua">
&quot;Regarding the pledge of allegiance to the "Republic."  When one "pledges" anything and 
particularly allegiance he/she is making an oath.  We have had oath discussions before 
but I don't think we take it seriously enough.  Though I have MAJOR issues with the Jehovah's 
Witnesses I must agree with them that taking an oath or a pledge goes against Scripture.  
Even they do not obey this when it comes to signing "under penalty of Perjury."  In my 
correspondence with Al Thompson he is adimate about this point.  He spends a great deal 
of time in the Bible and has concluded that this is the trap that gets us into those adhesion 
contracts and entanglements with the "system."  I tend to agree with him more and more.  
Technically, the only people that should work for [corporate] government, most of which 
requires an oath, are the non-believers.  When they become believers they should "come 
out of Babylon" so to speak and disengage themselves from satan's system.  As much as we 
can rely on the constitution it DOES require oaths.  Kinda makes you wonder, doesn't it?  
I've long since retired from making my "patriotism" a religion.  My wife and I both are 
military kids.  We grew up Very patriotic.  Making the pledge, singing the anthem hand 
over heart, signing under "penalty of Perjury."  We no longer claim a citizenship anywhere 
but God's Kingdom because of His promise.  Once the veil is lifted and satan's deception 
is exposed that is really all that we as believers have left.  It was really all that we 
had to begin with and that is what God has been trying to tell us since the Garden of Eden.  
Blind loyal nationalism has been the gravestone and suffering of so many millions of people 
it almost makes me ill.  America, despite its roots is NOT a Christian nation and will likely 
never be one.  The membership role of the Kingdom of Heaven is ours to expand no matter where 
we live.  THAT is my country.  HE is my King and whom I will serve.  He has jurisdiction.  
I will give to Him that which is His and to Caesar that which is Caesar's (nothing.)  
I am a bond servant of Christ and will take NO oaths to any other man, beast, or fiction 
for that would be trying to serve two masters.  That cannot be done.&quot; 
<br>--Rick; Hartz (Rickity) 9/30/2005
 <br><br>&quot;I could sent you the information on how the pledge of allegiance got started and by 
 whom [if you want] but a Christian could never give their allegiance to anyone other than God.  
 I would give my loyalty to this country which I have done, [being USMC retired] but my 
 allegiance is to God only.&quot;--Al Beyer 10/1/2005.
