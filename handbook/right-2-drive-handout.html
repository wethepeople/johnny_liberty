<P align=center>"NOTICE" TO PUBLIC SERVANTS intending to violate my free rights 
under law:</P></B></FONT><B>
<P>The Bearer, being an un-enfranchised Sovereign, is authorized under statute 
at large, First Congress 1789, Session 1, Chapters, page 52; Articles of 
Confederation, Article 4-3-1-1781; MC 38: Title 18, Section 241, USC Title 42, 
Section 1983, 1985, 1986, of the unhampered use of all navigable waters and all 
common law highways, roadways, and byways which are used for transport either 
private, public, or commerce anywhere in these United 50 States of America. Said 
driver/operator is affirmed in obedience for the protection of the Constitution 
for the United States of America and <U>may be detained only upon sworn 
complaint of an injured party</U> as per the Bill of Rights, Article IV, and 
common law. The undersigned claims his rights at law as a Sovereign citizen (NOT 
a resident) of Colorado state, and rejects, and is not subject to, the contract 
obligations in equity known as the Motor Vehicle Codes of the respective states, 
via U.C.C. 1.</P></B><B><FONT color=#ff0000>
<P>Notice: The "driver’s license" demanded, and provided under duress, which is 
issued by the state of Colorado, is NOT legally issued to me as a secured party 
with respect to the named party on the license, JEFFREY T. MAEHR, in all caps. 
</P></B></FONT><B><FONT color=#0000ff size=5>
<P>Case Law:</B></FONT> (Emphasis mine throughout)</P>
<P></P>
<P>Americans' "freedom to travel throughout the United States has long been 
recognized as a basic right under the Constitution," according to multiple cases 
including Williams v Fears, 179 US 270, 274; 21 S Ct 128; 45 L Ed 186 (1900); 
Twining v New Jersey, 211 US 78, 97; 29 S Ct 14; 53 L Ed 97 (1908), as listed in 
the case of United States v Guest, 383 US 745; 86 S Ct 1170; 16 L Ed 2d 239 
(1968), a case involving criminally prosecuting people for obstructing the right 
(obstruction is a federal crime pursuant to federal criminal law 18 USC  241). 
</P>
<P>Case law shows that the "liberty" protected by the Fourteenth Amendment 
extends beyond freedom from bodily restraint and includes a much wider range of 
human activity, including but not limited to the opportunity to make a wide 
range of personal decisions concerning one's life, family, and private pursuits. 
See Meyer v, 262 US 390, 399; 43 SCt 625, 626; 67 L Ed 1043 (1923), and Roe v 
Wade, 410 US 113, 152-153; 93 S Ct 705, 726-727; 35 L Ed 2d 147 (1973). One of 
these life, family, private pursuits is obviously driving. </P>
<P>In effect, as per the Supreme Court decision in the case of Crandall v 
Nevada, 73 US 35; 18 L Ed (1867), speed limits and other traffic control 
devices, being non-fact-based, are simply an unlawful tax or impost on travel, 
and thus unconstitutional for the reason cited in Crandall. (Crandall involved a 
tax on travelers! which is what in essence speed limits, unscientific stop 
signs, etc., simply are, stripped of all the phony fraudulent politician 
folderol pretending them to relate somehow to safety, not to mention that are 
extortion violating the federal anti-racketeering act (RICO), 18 USC 1961 and 
the law against obstructing federal rights, 18 USC  241). </P>
<P>42-2-101. Licenses for drivers required. </P>
<P><BR>(1) Except as otherwise provided in part 4 of this article for commercial 
drivers...</P>
<P>Colorado Article 42-2-101 clearly states, licensing is for commercial 
drivers, not private citizens.. </P>
<P>"...For while a citizen has the right to travel upon the public highways and 
to transport his property thereon, that right does not extend to the use of the 
highways...as a place for private gain. For the latter purpose, no person has a 
vested right to use the highways of this state, but it is a privilege...which 
the (state) may grant or withhold at its discretion..." State v. Johnson, 245 P 
1073.</P>
<P>"The right to travel is a part of the liberty of which a citizen cannot be 
deprived without due process of law under the Fifth Amendment."</P>
<P>"<B>Undoubtedly the right of locomotion</B>, the right to remove from one 
place to another according to inclination, is an attribute of personal liberty, 
and the right, ordinarily, of free transit from or through the territory of any 
State<B> is a right secured by the l4th Amendment </B>and by other provisions of 
the Constitution." - <U>Schactman v Dulles</U>, 96 App D.C. 287, 293.</P>
<P>"The right to travel is part of the Liberty of which the citizen cannot be 
deprived without due process of law under the Fifth Amendment." Kent v. Dulles 
357 U.S. 116, 125. Reaffirmed in Zemel v. Rusk 33 US 1.</P>
<P>"Where activities or enjoyment, natural and often necessary to the well being 
of an American citizen, such as travel, are involved, we will construe narrowly 
all delegated powers that curtail or dilute them... to repeat, we deal here with 
a constitutional right of the citizen..." Edwards v. California 314 US 160 
(1941).</P>
<P>"<B>Even the legislature has no power to deny to a citizen the right to 
travel upon the highway </B>and transport his property in the ordinary course of 
his business or pleasure, though this right may be <B>regulated </B>in 
accordance with the public interest and convenience. - <U>Chicago Motor Coach v 
Chicago</U>, 169 NE 22 ("<B>Regulated" here means stop lights, signs, etc. 
<U>NOT a privilege that requires permission or unconstitutional taxation;</U> 
i.e. - licensing, mandatory insurance, vehicle registration, etc., requiring 
financial consideration, which are more illegal taxes</B>.)</P>
<P>"The right of the citizen to travel upon the public highways and to transport 
his property thereon, either by carriage or by automobile,<B> is not a mere 
privilege which a city may prohibit or permit at will</B>, but a common right 
which he has under the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."- 
<U>Thompson v Smith</U>, 154 SE 579.</P>
<P>"The right to travel is protected by the Equal Protection Clause of the 
14<SUP>th</SUP> Amendment."</P>
<P>"Right to travel is constitutionally protected against private as well as 
public encroachment."</P>
<P>Volunteer Medical Clinic, Inc. V. Operation Rescue, 948 F2d 218; 
International Org. Of Masters, Etc. V. Andrews, 831, F2d 843; Zobel v. Williams, 
457 US 55, 102 Sct. 2309.</P>
<P>"The right to make use of an automobile as a vehicle of travel along the 
highways of the state, is no longer an open question. The owners thereof have 
the same rights in the roads and streets as the drivers of horses or those 
riding a bicycle or traveling in some vehicle." House v. Cramer, 1 12 N. W. 3; 
134 Iowa 374 (1907).</P>
<P>"<B>License</B>: In the law of contracts, is a permission, accorded by a 
competent authority, conferring the right to do some act which without such 
authorization would be illegal, or would be a trespass or tort." Blacks Law 
Dictionary, 2<SUP>nd</SUP> Ed. (1910).</P>
<P>"The license means to confer on a person the right to do something which 
otherwise he would not have the right to do." City of Louisville v. Sebree, 214 
S.W. 2D 248; 308 Ky. 420.</P>
<P>"The object of a license is to confer a right or power which does not exist 
without it." Pavne v. Massev, 196 S.W. 2D 493; 145 Tex. 273; Shuman v. City of 
Ft. Wayne, 127 Indiana 109; 26 NE 560, 561 (1891); 194 So 569 (1940).</P>
<P>"A license is a mere permit to do something that without it would be 
unlawful." Littleton v. Buress, 82 P. 864, 866; 14 Wyo.173.</P>
<P>"A license, pure and simple, is a mere personal privilege...River Development 
Corp. V. Liberty Corp., 133 A. 2d 373, 385; 45 N.J. Super. 445.</P>
<P>"A license is merely a permit or privilege to do what otherwise would be 
unlawful, and is not a contract between the authority, federal, state or 
municipal granting it and the person to whom it is granted..."American States 
Water Services Co. Of Calif. V. Johnson, 88 P.2d 770, 774; 31 Cal. App.2d 
606.</P>
<P>"A license when granting a privilege, may not, as the terms to its 
possession, impose conditions which require the abandonment of constitutional 
rights." Frost Trucking Co. V. Railroad Commission, 271 US 583, 589 (1924); 
Terral v. Burke Construction Company, 257 US 529, 532 (1922).</P>
<P>Public roads belong to the people, since we pay for them, therefore 
exercising one’s liberty upon them is a natural right. The right to travel, or 
to locomotion, is upheld in the constitution, and actually predate the 
constitution;</P>
<P>"These are rights which existed long before our constitution, and we have 
taken pride in their maintenance, making them a part of the fundamental law of 
the land." </P>
<P>"Personal liberty, which is guaranteed to every citizen under our 
constitution and laws, consists of the right to locomotion,—to go where one 
pleases, and when, and to do that which may lead to one's business or pleasure, 
only so far restrained as the rights of others may make it necessary for the 
welfare of all other citizens. . . . </P>
<P>"Any law which would place the keeping and safe conduct of another in the 
hands of even a conservator of the peace, unless for some breach of the peace 
committed in his presence, or upon suspicion of felony, would be most oppressive 
and unjust, and destroy all the rights which our Constitution guarantees." 
Pinkerton v <I>Verberg</I>, 78 Mich 573, 584; 44 NW 579, 582-583 (1889). </P>
<P>The general rule is that an unconstitutional statute, though <B>having the 
form and name of law</B>, is in reality no law, <B>but is wholly void and 
ineffective for any purpose</B>, since its unconstitutionality dates from the 
time of its enactment... <B>In legal contemplation, it is as inoperative as if 
it had never been passed</B>... Since an unconstitutional law is void, the 
general principles follow that it <B>imposes no duties, confers no right, 
creates no office, bestows no power or authority on anyone, affords no 
protection and justifies no acts performed under it.</B>.. A void act cannot be 
legally consistent with a valid one. An unconstitutional law cannot operate to 
supersede any existing law. Indeed insofar as a statute runs counter to the 
<B>fundamental law of the land, (the Constitution </B>JTM) it is superseded 
thereby. <B>No one is bound to obey an unconstitutional law and no courts are 
bound to enforce it." </B>Bonnett v. Vallier, 116 N.W. 885, 136 Wis. 193 (1908); 
NORTON v. SHELBY COUNTY, 118 U.S. 425 (1886) </P>
<P>"The word privilege is defined as a particular benefit, favor, or advantage, 
a right or immunity not enjoyed by all, or it may be enjoyed only under special 
conditions." Knoll Gold Club v. U.S., 179 Fed Supp. 377, 380.</P>
<P>"...those things which are considered as inalienable rights which all 
citizens possess cannot be licensed since those acts are not held to be a 
privilege." City of Chicago v. Collins, 51 N.E. 907, 910</P>
<P>"Illegitimate and unconstitutional practices get their first footing in that 
way, by silent approaches and slight deviations from legal modes of procedure. 
This can only be obviated by adhering to the rule that constitutional provisions 
for the security of persons and property should be liberally construed." Boyd v. 
United States, 116 U.S. 616, 635 (1884); Exparte Rhodes, 202Ala. 68 71.</P>

and</FONT><B> a citation/ticket issued by a police officer, or

<P></P>
<P>"The use of the highway for the purpose of <B>travel and transportation is

<P>1. Belligerency -</B> the status of de facto statehood attributed to a body

<BR><B>2. Belligerent -</B> One who is hostile or combative which as a state is 
hostile, combative and wages war hostilities and aggression against its own 
citizens by a body of insurgents by which their war hostilities are presumed 
legalized. <BR><B>3. Privateer -</B> A vessel owned, equipped, and armed by one 
or more individuals, and duly commissioned by a belligerent power to make war 
upon the enemy, usually by preying on his commerce. A vessel is commissioned by 
a state or a nation by the issue of a letter of marque to its owner to carry on 
all hostilities, presumably according to the laws of war. Formerly a state 
issued letters of marque to its own subjects, and to those of neutral states as 
well, but a privateersman who accepted letters of marque from both belligerents 
was regarded as a pirate. Piracy and Privateering are Federal offences 18 USCA 
1692 et seq. See Black’s Law Dictionary 6th Edition page 1195 <BR><B>4. Letter

Those acts of robbery and depredation upon the high seas, which if committed on
